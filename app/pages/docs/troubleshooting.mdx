This documentation explains how you can debug your Blitz frontend and
backend code with full source maps support using either the
[VS Code debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) or
[Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools).

Any debugger that can attach to Node.js can also be used to debug a Blitz
application. You can find more details in the Node.js
[Debugging Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/).

## Debugging with VS Code {#vscode}

Create a file named `.vscode/launch.json` at the root of your project with
the following content:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Blitz: debug server-side",
      "type": "node-terminal",
      "request": "launch",
      "command": "npm run dev"
    },
    {
      "name": "Blitz: debug client-side",
      "type": "pwa-chrome",
      "request": "launch",
      "url": "http://localhost:3000"
    },
    {
      "name": "Blitz: debug full stack",
      "type": "node-terminal",
      "request": "launch",
      "command": "npm run dev",
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "serverReadyAction": {
        "pattern": "started server on .+, url: (https?://.+)",
        "uriFormat": "%s",
        "action": "debugWithChrome"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`npm run dev` can be replaced with `yarn dev` if you're using Yarn, or
with `blitz dev` if you have Blitz installed globally. If you're
[changing the port number](./cli-dev) your application starts on, replace
the `3000` in `http://localhost:3000` with the port you're using instead.

Now go to the Debug panel (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>
on Windows/Linux, <kbd>⇧</kbd>+<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> on macOS), select
a launch configuration, then press <kbd>F5</kbd> or select **Debug: Start
Debugging** from the Command Palette to start your debugging session.

## Debugging with Chrome DevTools {#chrome-devtools}

### Client-side code {#chrome-devtools-client}

Start your development server as usual by running `blitz dev`,
`npm run dev`, or `yarn dev`. Once the server starts, open
`http://localhost:3000` (or your alternate URL) in Chrome. Next, open
Chrome's Developer Tools (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd> on
Windows/Linux, <kbd>⌥</kbd>+<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> on macOS), then go
to the **Sources** tab

Now, any time your client-side code reaches a
[`debugger`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/debugger)
statement, code execution will pause and that file will appear in the
debug area. You can also press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> on
Windows/Linux or <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> on macOS to search for a file
and set breakpoints manually. Note that when searching here, your source
files will have paths starting with `webpack://_N_E/./`.

### Server-side code {#chrome-devtools-server}

To debug server-side Blitz code with Chrome DevTools, you need to pass the
[`--inspect`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_inspect_host_port) flag
to the underlying Node.js process:

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' blitz dev
```

If you're using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` (see
[Getting Started](/docs/getting-started)) then you should update the `dev`
script on your `package.json`:

```json
"dev": "NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' blitz dev"
```

Launching the Blitz dev server with the `--inspect` flag will look
something like this:

```bash
Debugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9229/0cf90313-350d-4466-a748-cd60f4e47c95
For help, see: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector
ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
```

> Be aware that running `NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' npm run dev` or
> `NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' yarn dev` won't work. This would try to start
> multiple debuggers on the same port: one for the npm/yarn process and
> one for Blitz. You would then get an error like
> `Starting inspector on 127.0.0.1:9229 failed: address already in use` in
> your console.

Once the server starts, open a new tab in Chrome and visit
`chrome://inspect`, where you should see your Blitz application inside the
**Remote Target** section. Click **inspect** under your application to
open a separate DevTools window, then go to the **Sources** tab.

Debugging server-side code here works much like debugging client-side code
with Chrome DevTools, except that when you search for files here with

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>, your source
files will have paths starting with `webpack://{application - name}/./`
(where `{application - name}` will be replaced with the name of your
application according to your `package.json` file).
